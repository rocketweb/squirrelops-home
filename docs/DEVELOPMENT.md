## First-Time Setup

### 1. Install the Privileged Helper

The packaged sensor delegates privileged operations to a Swift helper daemon that runs as root. The helper accepts RPC only from root and the dedicated `_squirrelops` service account. A sensor run directly as your login user cannot use the helper, so ARP scanning, virtual IP aliases, and port forwarding are unavailable in that mode and are reported as unavailable.

```bash
sudo bash scripts/dev-install-helper.sh
```

This builds the helper from `app/` via Swift Package Manager and installs it as a system launchd daemon for root-level RPC testing. Full end-to-end helper testing requires the `.pkg` service account setup:

| Item | Path |
|------|------|
| Binary | `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.squirrelops.helper` |
| Launchd plist | `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.squirrelops.helper.plist` |
| Socket | `/var/run/squirrelops-helper.sock` |
| Logs | `/var/log/com.squirrelops.helper.log` |

The helper starts immediately and persists across reboots (`KeepAlive: true`).

To update after changing helper source code:

```bash
sudo bash scripts/dev-install-helper.sh
```

To remove:

```bash
sudo bash scripts/dev-install-helper.sh --uninstall
```

### 2. Install Sensor Dependencies

```bash
cd sensor
uv sync
```

---

## Running Locally

### Sensor

```bash
cd sensor
uv run python -m squirrelops_home_sensor --port 8443
```

The sensor uses the config at `sensor/data/config.yaml` and stores its SQLite database in `sensor/data/`.

Useful flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--port 8443` | API port (default 8443) |
| `--config path/to/config.yaml` | Custom config file |
| `--no-tls` | Disable TLS and force a loopback-only bind (for quick testing) |

### macOS App

```bash
cd app
bash build-app.sh
open .build/$(uname -m)-apple-macosx/debug/SquirrelOpsHome.app
```

> **Note:** Debug builds skip `SMAppService` helper registration (requires code signing). Use `dev-install-helper.sh` instead — see [First-Time Setup](#1-install-the-privileged-helper).

### Running Tests

```bash
cd sensor
uv run pytest tests/ -q    # ~1258 tests
```

Run a specific test file or class:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_mimic_server.py -q
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_scout_engine.py::TestGetMimicCandidates -q
```

## Architecture: Privileged Helper

The helper (`SquirrelOpsHelper`) is a Swift binary that runs as root via launchd. It listens on a Unix domain socket and speaks JSON-RPC 2.0.

```
┌──────────────────────┐         JSON-RPC / Unix socket
│  Python Sensor       │ ─────────────────────────────────►  ┌──────────────────┐
│  (runs as _squirrelops)│  /var/run/squirrelops-helper.sock │  SquirrelOpsHelper│
│                      │ ◄─────────────────────────────────  │  (runs as root)  │
└──────────────────────┘                                     └──────────────────┘
```

**RPC methods:**

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `runARPScan` | Discover devices on the subnet via ARP |
| `runServiceScan` | TCP port/service enumeration (nmap) |
| `addIPAlias` | Add virtual IP alias (`ifconfig alias`) |
| `removeIPAlias` | Remove virtual IP alias |
| `setupPortForwards` | Configure pfctl rdr rules for privileged ports |
| `clearPortForwards` | Remove pfctl rules |
| `startDNSSniff` | Start passive DNS query capture |
| `stopDNSSniff` | Stop DNS capture |
| `getDNSQueries` | Retrieve captured DNS queries |

**Why a helper?** macOS requires root for raw sockets (ARP), `ifconfig` alias manipulation, and `pfctl` rules. Rather than running the entire sensor as root, only the helper runs privileged. Its socket is `root:_squirrelops` mode `0660`, and peer credentials are checked again after connection.

**On Linux/Docker**, the sensor runs as root with `CAP_NET_RAW` and `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, so it performs these operations directly using scapy and iptables. No helper needed.

---

## Debugging

### Helper not responding

```bash
# Check if the daemon is loaded
sudo launchctl print system/com.squirrelops.helper

# Check if the socket exists
ls -la /var/run/squirrelops-helper.sock

# View helper logs
tail -f /var/log/com.squirrelops.helper.log

# Restart the helper
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.squirrelops.helper

# Reinstall from source
sudo bash scripts/dev-install-helper.sh
```

### Test helper connectivity manually

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"runARPScan","params":{"subnet":"192.168.1.0/24"},"id":1}' \
  | sudo nc -U /var/run/squirrelops-helper.sock
```

### Sensor shows 0 devices

The helper isn't running or isn't reachable. Check the socket and helper logs as above.

### Deploy returns `{"deployed": 0}` or 503

- **503 with "Privileged helper is not running"**: Helper isn't installed. Run `dev-install-helper.sh`.
- **200 with `{"deployed": 0}`**: No mimic candidates. Run scouts first to discover services, then deploy.

### Sensor warnings about virtual IP alias failures

```
Failed to add IP alias 192.168.1.200 on en0
```

The helper isn't running or can't execute `ifconfig`. Reinstall and check logs.

## Build Pipeline

### Local builds

| Target | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Sensor (editable) | `cd sensor && uv sync` |
| App (debug) | `cd app && bash build-app.sh` |
| App (release) | `cd app && BUILD_CONFIG=release bash build-app.sh` |
| Installer (.pkg) | `bash scripts/build-pkg.sh` |

### Release workflow

Releases are triggered by pushing a `v*` tag. The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) handles:

1. Code signing with Developer ID certificates
2. Building the `.pkg` installer (app + sensor + helper)
3. Notarization with Apple
4. Creating the GitHub Release with the `.pkg` artifact
5. Updating `site/public/manifest.json` for auto-update
